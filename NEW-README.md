# üõç Multi-Cart

A fake "**fancy shopping cart**" app built for demo purposes with:
* **React**, 
* **GraphQL** (urql), 
* **Terraform**,
* **AppSync**,
* and other tech.

üëç**tldr:** is a full-stack serverless web application (not responsive or mobile-first design at this stage), that is very nearly production-ready and enterprise-grade, can be used as a starter project, and includes robust testing, CICD, shared libraries between the FE & BE, and is team-ready.





# Quick Demo

![multi-cart-overview]()

üî¥ TODO: keep it under 10 mb! for Github-issues trick!





# Purpose 

This was built for purposes of `self-study as I was upskilling` from **angular & node/REST APIs** to **react** along with various GraphQL backends, namely:

* first **react** & <u>PostgreSQL+TypeOrm+TypeGraphQL</u> (after diligently going thru [Ben Awad's 14-hour Full-Stack React Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ypD7qv3Z8))
* then **react** & a <u>mocked</u> GraphQL backend (for rapid UI development, using Next.js' public api pages)
* and finally **react** & a <u>serverless</u> backend (with Terraform+AppSync+DynamoDB+Cognito)

In addition to building the app, I also strove to include the latest web development **best practices and tools**, that I had been wanting to learn and use for a long time, such as using:

- React (urql, formik, redux, Context, etc.)
- nx mono-repo (shared libraries)
- Chakra-UI
- Storybook
- Jest
- Cypress
- Next.js
- Terraform
- AWS (AppSync, Cognito, DynamoDB, etc.)
- etc.

I also did my best to keep things as **Production-ready** as I could, for instance with multiple environments and safe secrets management, as well as keeping the project **Team-ready** as well, so that other contributors could jump right in and pitch in development into the CICD workflows. 

I designed the **CICD** workflows to make full use of my testing pyramid -- i.e. not merging PRs if tests fail, and keeping things as automated as possible. There's definitely room for improvement, see the CICD section below details, but it all works fine as-is and does not take too long (dozens of e2e tests running in parallel complete in a couple minutes, the entire pipeline taking less than 20 minutes).

Additionally, I tried to leverage **cloud** and  **"Cloud-Native"** technologies as much as possible, for example:

* using Terraform Cloud, Cypress Dashboard, GitHub Actions, and Vercel

* choosing AWS "Cloud Native" **VTL** template resolvers over Lambdas wherever possible

  * > to minimize cold start and latency due to network I/O for resolver invocation...

Finally, one of my primary goals was to basically build a **enterprise-grade starter boilerplate** that I could use on future projects, that was also **scalable**. Using Terraform, AppSync, DynamoDB, and Cognito allow for that. Cognito apparently can handle millions of users for authentication out-of-the-gate with minimal adjustment. With DynamoDB, you would need to add some `autoscaling` configurations, and so forth.  On the front-end, the Vercel Edge Network handles most of that for us.

Keep in mind this is a **work-in-progress**, many things are mocked (like Products and the dashboard), and incomplete (like UOMs and Categories). Caveats, limitations, and issues are detailed below.

This was **inspired by** the many shopping cart and e-commerce projects I have worked on in the past, and is a loose conglomeration of some of them.

NOTE: *I built this in approx. 4 months at the beginning of 2021, you can see all my GIT commits for more info.*







# How to install

You will need `yarn` and `node` installed on your machine for this to work:

```sh
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/charlieargue/multi-cart

# change directory 
cd multi-cart

# install libraries (this can take a few minutes)
yarn
```





# Quick Start

**1. Setup environment variables**

In order to run the front-end locally, you'll need a `.env.local` environment variable file in the `apps/multi-cart/` directory:

```sh
# copy env file (this assumes you are in the root multi-cart directory)
cp apps/multi-cart/.env.dist apps/multi-cart/.env.local
```

Edit `apps/multi-cart/.env.local` to have these two keys (you can ignore the other ones):

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://pcuynwb3tfbbzjfygrljfoej3q.appsync-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/graphql
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=da2-zrexcuvmlvhj3oxbzp3nby7ipq
```

**2. Start up front-end**

Then you can start the local web development server and fire up the front-end with:

```sh
yarn start		
```

You can view the site at:

* http://localhost:4200/

### [ ] üî• Show Dependency Graph!







# Testing

[ ] üî• Show Testing pyramid

[ ] show how to run ALL tests locally!



# Serverless (Terraform Cloud & AWS):

[ ] explain that remote execution, so need to setup TF CLoud, env vars, etc... (screen shots, or NO, SKIP ALL THAT< not the point here?!) just broadly, show settings screenshots quickly, it's easy maybe, ok?)

[ ] explain that only DEV and PROD envs (no local, never tf plan/apply locally, etc... remote state)



# CICD

[ ] üî• Show CICD diagram (update it plz!)

[ ] explain need to move KEYS up into TF Cloud,  

[ ] explain TF notification -> GHA webhook



# Caveats/Issues

### üî¥ CURRENT KNOWN ISSUES:
- you will need AWS credentials installed globally
- I'm still using ROOT USER instead of a sub-AWS-user, WIP
